**tl;dr**

- Node streams are great, except for all the ways in which they're
  terrible.
- A new Stream implementation is coming in 0.10, that has gotten the
  nickname "streams2".
- Readable streams have a `read()` method that returns a buffer or
  null. (More documentation included below.)
- `'data'` events, `pause()`, and `resume()` will still work as before
  (except that they'll actually work how you'd expect).
- Old programs will **almost always** work without modification, but
  streams start out in a paused state, and need to be read from to be
  consumed.
- **WARNING**: If you never add a `'data'` event handler, or call
  `resume()`, then it'll sit in a paused state forever and never
  emit `'end'`.

Throughout the life of Node, we've been gradually iterating on the
ideal event-based API for handling data. Over time, this developed
into the "Stream" interface that you see throughout Node's core
modules and many of the modules in npm.

Consistent interfaces increase the portability and reliability of our
programs and libraries. Overall, the move from domain-specific events
and methods towards a unified stream interface was a huge win.
However, there are still several problems with Node's streams as of
v0.8. In a nutshell:

1. The `pause()` method doesn't pause. It is advisory-only. In
   Node's implementation, this makes things much simpler, but it's
   confusing to users, and doesn't do what it looks like it does.
2. `'data'` events come right away (whether you're ready or not).
   This makes it unreasonably difficult to do common tasks like load a
   user's session before deciding how to handle their request.
3. There is no way to consume a specific number of bytes, and then
   leave the rest for some other part of the program to deal with.
4. It's unreasonably difficult to implement streams and get all the
   intricacies of pause, resume, write-buffering, and data events
   correct. The lack of shared classes mean that we all have to solve
   the same problems repeatedly, making similar mistakes and similar
   bugs.

Common simple tasks should be easy, or we aren't doing our job.
People often say that Node is better than most other platforms at this
stuff, but in my opinion, that is less of a compliment and more of an
indictment of the current state of software. Being better than the
next guy isn't enough; we have to be the best imaginable. While they
were a big step in the right direction, the Streams in Node up until
now leave a lot wanting.

So, just fix it, right?

Well, we are sitting on the results of several years of explosive
growth in the Node community, so any changes have to be made very
carefully. If we break all the Node programs in 0.10, then no one
will ever want to upgrade to 0.10, and it's all pointless. We had
this conversation around 0.4, then again around 0.6, then again around
0.8. Every time, the conclusion has been "Too much work, too hard to
make backwards-compatible", and we always had more pressing problems
to solve.

In 0.10, we cannot put it off any longer. We've bitten the bullet and
are making a significant change to the Stream implementation. You may
have seen conversations on twitter or IRC or the mailing list about
"streams2". I also gave [a talk in
November](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3685/presentations/streams2/streams2-ko.pdf)
about this subject. A lot of node module authors have been involved
with the development of streams2 (and of course the node core team).

## streams2

The feature is described pretty thoroughly in the documentation, so
I'm including it below. Please read it, especially the section on
"compatibility". There's a caveat there that is unfortunately
unavoidable, but hopefully enough of an edge case that it's easily
worked around.

The first preview release with this change will be 0.9.4. I highly
recommend trying this release and providing feedback before it lands
in a stable version.

As of writing this post, there are some known performance regressions,
especially in the http module. We are fanatical about maintaining
performance in Node.js, so of course this will have to be fixed before
the v0.10 stable release. (Watch for a future blog post on the tools
and techniques that have been useful in tracking down these issues.)

There may be minor changes as necessary to fix bugs and improve
performance, but the API at this point should be considered feature
complete. It correctly does all the things we need it to do, it just
doesn't do them quite well enough yet. As always, be wary of running
unstable releases in production, of course, but I encourage you to try
it out and see what you think. Especially, if you have tests that you
can run on your modules and libraries, that would be extremely useful
feedback.

# Stream

> Stability: 2 - Unstable

A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in
Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is
stdout. Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are
instances of [EventEmitter][]

You can load the Stream base classes by doing `require('stream')`.
There are base classes provided for Readable streams, Writable
streams, Duplex streams, and Transform streams.

## Compatibility

In earlier versions of Node, the Readable stream interface was
simpler, but also less powerful and less useful.

- Rather than waiting for you to call the `read()` method, `'data'`
  events would start emitting immediately. If you needed to do some
  I/O to decide how to handle data, then you had to store the chunks
  in some kind of buffer so that they would not be lost.
- The `pause()` method was advisory, rather than guaranteed. This
  meant that you still had to be prepared to receive `'data'` events
  even when the stream was in a paused state.

In Node v0.10, the Readable class described below was added. For
backwards compatibility with older Node programs, Readable streams
switch into "old mode" when a `'data'` event handler is added, or when
the `pause()` or `resume()` methods are called. The effect is that,
even if you are not using the new `read()` method and `'readable'`
event, you no longer have to worry about losing `'data'` chunks.

Most programs will continue to function normally. However, this
introduces an edge case in the following conditions:

```typescript
let r: string = new Readable();
r.push('your text here');
```
